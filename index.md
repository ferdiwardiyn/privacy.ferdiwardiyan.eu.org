# WHY	WE’RE	SHARING	THIS	PRIVACY	POLICY	WITH	YOU
### Protecting	the	privacy	of	your	financial	information	is	important	to	us.	Facebook	Payments	Inc.	
### (“Facebook	Payments”)	wants	to	be	open	and	transparent	about	how	your	personal	information	is	
### collected	and	the	limited	way	it’s	used.

We’re	committed	to	keeping	your	non-public	personal	financial	information	confidential.	This	
information	includes	your	credit	card	or	other	payment	method	information.	From	here	on,	we’ll	just	
call	this	“Personal	Information”	for	the	sake	of	space.

We	may	need	to	share	your	Personal	Information	under	certain	circumstances:	so	we	can	offer	you	the	
best	service	possible,	to	run	our	business,	or	to	comply	with	legal	requests.	We’ll	go	into	more	detail	
about	these	circumstances	later	in	the	document.

### Please	read	this	Privacy	Policy.	It’ll	help	you	understand	what	information	we	share,	what	we	don’t	
### share,	and	how	to	keep	your	information	safe.

Facebook	Payments is	a	separate	company	from	Facebook,	Inc.	Facebook	Payments	will	not	share	your	
Personal	Information	with	anyone,	including	with	Facebook,	Inc.	or	other	affiliated	companies,	except	at	
times	which	we’ll	describe	later	in	this	Policy.

Facebook	Payments	only	receives	limited	Personal	Information	from	you	-- specifically,	your	credit	card	
numbers	and	other	payment	method	information.	For	information	about	Facebook,	Inc.’s	general	
privacy	policies,	please	visit https://www.facebook.com/policy.php.

# HOW	WE	USE	YOUR	INFO
When	you	give	your	Personal	Information	to	Facebook	Payments,	we	only	use	this	information	to	help	
you	make	payments	on	the	Facebook	website	and	platform.

# HOW	WE	SHARE	YOUR	INFO
Facebook	Payments	won’t	share	your	Personal	Information	with	anyone	for	marketing	purposes	without	
your	explicit	consent.
We	won’t	sell	or	rent	your	Personal	Information	to	anyone	outside	of	Facebook	Payments,	including	our	
parent	company,	Facebook,	Inc.	We’ll	only	give	this	info	when	it’s	needed	to	process	your	payment,	or	if	
it’s	a	legal	requirement,	like	in	response	to	a	subpoena	or	an	independent	audit.	We	require	that	anyone	
who	receives	this	information	will	only	use	it	for	those	purposes.
We	may	share	your	Personal	Information	with	our	parent	company	Facebook,	Inc.	This	will	happen	for	
specific	reasons:
• to	process	your	payment;
• for	maintenance	of	your	payment	account;	or
• to	detect,	prevent,	or	otherwise	address	fraud,	security,	or	technical	issues.

We	require	Facebook,	Inc.	to	use	this	information	only	for	these	specific	purposes.

# HOW	TO	ACCESS	AND	UPDATE	YOUR	PERSONAL	INFORMATION
You	can	view	and	update	your	Personal	Information,	including	deleting	credit	cards	or	other	payment	
methods,	by	going	to	the	Payments	Settings	page	in	your	Facebook	account	settings.

If	you	disable	your	Facebook	account,	you	won’t	be	able	to	access	your	Personal	Information.	We	keep	
some	of	it	on	file	just	for	legal	reporting	and	auditing	obligations.	Facebook	Payments	will	not	use	
Personal	Information	associated	with	a	disabled	account	for	any	reason	besides	meeting	these	
obligations.	We	may	delete	records	associated	with	disabled	accounts	over	time	as	permitted	or	
required	by	law.

# HOW	WE	KEEP	YOUR	PERSONAL	INFORMATION	SECURE
We	take	appropriate	security	measures	to	protect	against	unauthorized	access	and	unauthorized	
changes,	sharing,	or	destruction	of	your	Personal	Information.	These	security	measures	include	internal	
reviews	of	our	data	collection,	storage	and	processing	practices,	and	security	measures,	as	well	as	
physical	and	technical	security	measures	to	guard	against	unauthorized	access	to	systems	where	we	
store	personal	data.	Facebook	Payments	uses	industry-leading	encryption	standards	for	your	Personal	
Information.	For	example,	your	credit	card	number	will	always	be	stored	in	an	encrypted	form.

The	security	of	your	account	also	depends	on	keeping	your	account	password	confidential.	You	should	
not	share	your	account	name	or	password	with	anyone.	If	you	give	your	password	to	someone	else	(like	a	
significant	other,	your	boss,	or	a	website),	they	will	have	access	to	your	account	and	your	Personal	
Information.
